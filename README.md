# Echo Operator Workspace

This is the working directory for **Echo** — the autonomous AI operator running on macOS for `@0xwaya`.

---

## Stack Overview

### OpenClaw Gateway
- Version: `2026.3.2`
- Port: `18789` (loopback only)
- Service: `ai.openclaw.gateway` (launchd)
- Auth: bearer token injected at startup by `tools/secret-bootstrap.sh`
  - Secrets must be encrypted at rest (`credentials/openclaw.env.enc` + key) or injected by environment (launchd/CI/secret manager)

### Runtime Layers (`runtime/echo-core/` + sandbox backend)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `runtime/echo-core/sandbox_bridge.py` | Stable production runtime facade used by Dashboard and Telegram paths |
| `tools/echo-runtime-invoke.sh` | Stable invoke entrypoint for production channel execution |
| `tools/echo-tracing-check.sh` | One-command tracing bootstrap check against live `.env` |
| `sandboxes/langraph-echo-sandbox/echo_agent.py` | Backend agent core retained for compatibility and R&D |
| `sandboxes/langraph-echo-sandbox/lc_adapter.py` | LLM invocation layer — rate limits, HARD STOP guards, session budget |

### Tracing Highlights

- Tracing is opt-in and controlled by `.env` (`ECHO_TRACING_ENABLED=1`).
- Runtime bridge now initializes tracing on the production invoke path when enabled.
- Verify with: `/Users/pc/.openclaw/tools/echo-tracing-check.sh`

### MemPalace Integration Highlights

- MemPalace is integrated as Echo's backend memory substrate (wake-up + retrieval), not as a parallel control UI.
- Primary launch path is gateway-native: `openclaw dashboard` / `openclaw gateway` triggers MemPalace warmup through internal `boot-md` + `workspace/BOOT.md`.
- Startup warmup command is centralized in `tools/mempalace-startup.sh` with cooldown protection and audit logs in `logs/mempalace-startup.log`.
- Runtime flags are controlled from the OpenClaw env path (`~/.openclaw/.env`), keeping Dashboard and Telegram as the production operator surfaces.
- Integration follows MemPalace's local-first model (wake-up + on-demand search) with wing-scoped retrieval support.

### Telegram AAAK Compression (2026-04-10)

- Telegram channel is now configured to auto-compress all messages using MemPalace AAAK before send.
- Binary binding: `ECHO_MEMPALACE_BIN=/Users/pc/.openclaw/tools/echo-mempalace.sh` (in `.env` / hook env)
- Trigger: `gateway-aaak-preflight` hook detects Telegram events and spawns `mempalace compress --wing sandboxes`
- No user action required; compression is fully automatic and transparent.

### Model Routing

| Tier | Model | Used for |
|------|-------|----------|
| Strategic | `gpt-4.1` | Complex reasoning, CEO analysis |
| Operational | `gpt-4.1-mini` | Telegram replies, echo_agent synthesis |
| Background | `gpt-4.1-nano` | Lightweight/fallback tasks |

### Explicit Agent Defaults

These are now pinned through the native Gateway `config.get` / `config.set` / `config.apply` path instead of ad hoc per-surface overrides.

| Agent | Primary Model | Reason |
|------|---------------|--------|
| `main` | `openai/gpt-4.1-mini` | Stable default operator path |
| `nano-banana-pro` | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | Correct provider wiring for the Google-backed agent |
| `openai-image-gen` | `openai/gpt-5-image` | Explicit image-generation default |

The engineering override remains separate from these defaults:
- Engineering toggle primary: `openai/gpt-5.2-codex`
- Engineering toggle fallback: `openai/gpt-5.3-codex`

## Native Architecture

The current architecture is intentionally **gateway-native first**.

- Control UI model edits should go through the OpenClaw Gateway on port `18789`, not through the Flask sandbox UI.
- Agent model selection belongs to the Gateway config/agents surfaces, where `agents.list` and `agents.defaults` are already first-class config paths.
- Usage visibility should come from the native `sessions.usage` and `sessions.usage.timeseries` RPCs first, with the local ledger monitor as the second line of defense.
- Python OpenAI calls must go through `lc_adapter.echo_invoke()` so budget guards, token accounting, retries, and hard stops are enforced centrally.

### OpenClaw UI Threading Surface

- The browser Control UI is already a native OpenClaw client, not a separate chat stack.
- It connects with gateway client id `openclaw-control-ui` and client mode `webchat`.
- The shared internal message channel for the browser chat surface is `webchat`.
- The existing chat UI already includes the main primitives needed for thread-bound session work:
  - session selection
  - new session creation
  - session-aware history loading
  - assistant identity refresh
  - session-scoped send and abort flows
- Thread-related capability structures already exist in the packaged runtime:
  - channel capabilities can declare `threads` and chat type `thread`
  - threading context/tool context types already exist for message and tool handoff
  - message action adapters already support action-level integration points such as thread-oriented actions
  - session-binding services already exist for binding conversations to ACP or subagent sessions
- The current local runtime patch extends that built-in session-binding surface to `webchat` by registering a `webchat/default` adapter with `current` and `child` placements.
  - The current local runtime patch also adds explicit `channels.webchat.threadBindings` config/schema support and ACP harness-id canonicalization for backend runtime calls.
- Current behavior after the patch:
  - ACP session-mode spawn is no longer blocked by a missing webchat binding adapter
  - webchat conversation-to-session bindings can now be resolved through the same binding service used by Discord
  - the gateway service has been restarted successfully after the patch
- Remaining gaps are now above the core binding layer:
  - Control UI actions for creating or focusing thread-bound sessions
  - end-to-end ACP spawn validation on the webchat command path
  - lifecycle validation, persistence tests, and rollout hardening

Operational docs maintained in local workspace state:
- `api-ratelimit.md` — budget policy, incident history, daily checkpoints
- `memory/memory.md` — persistent cross-session facts and architecture decisions

## Echo Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/run <cmd>` or `/exec` | Run shell command (600s timeout; metacharacters blocked) |
| `/file <path>` or `/read` | Read file (max 64KB, no binary; strict path guards when `ECHO_STRICT_FS=1`) |
| `/write <path> :: <content>` | Write file (strict path guards when `ECHO_STRICT_FS=1`) |
| `/skill <name>` | Invoke an OpenClaw skill |
| `/do <skill> [args]` | Alias for `/skill` |
| `/note <text>` | Append note to today's memory file |
| `/mem` or `/memory` | Show today's memory excerpt |
| `/status` | Show Echo runtime status |
| `/help` or `/?` | List all commands |

## Rate Limits & Guards

| Guard | Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Tool calls per message | 20 | Hard cap — returns budget warning after limit |
| Total API calls per task | 50 | `lc_adapter` global cap (budgeted per channel) |
| Session tokens | 500K | `lc_adapter` global cap (budgeted per channel) |
| Shell timeout | 600s | Process killed, error returned |
| Wall-clock timeout | 600s | `handle()` returns partial |

Per-channel budgets (lc_adapter):
- global: 50 calls / 500K tokens
- telegram: 20 calls / 200K tokens
- dashboard: 30 calls / 300K tokens
- background: 10 calls / 100K tokens

**HARD STOP keywords** (stop all API calls immediately):  
`insufficient_quota` · `billing` · `hard_limit`

**NOT a HARD STOP** — `rate_limit_exceeded` (429) is retried up to 3x with exponential backoff.

Model guardrails:
- Operational and background calls are restricted to `gpt-4.1-mini` or `gpt-4.1-nano`.
- Optional override: set `ECHO_FORCE_MINI_ONLY=1` to force strategic mode to `gpt-4.1-mini`.

## Optimization Path

Recent optimization work followed this sequence:

1. API usage spike investigation identified that dashboard chat was bypassing `lc_adapter` and calling `ChatOpenAI` directly.
2. Budget enforcement was restored by routing dashboard chat through `echo_invoke(budget_key="dashboard")`.
3. A local monitor was added over `logs/rl_ledger.jsonl` to detect burst buckets and produce machine-readable budget summaries.
4. Model/agent selection was moved back to the correct control surface: the OpenClaw Gateway dashboard.
5. Explicit native agent defaults were set through gateway config so model wiring is visible, durable, and schema-validated.
6. Persistent structured memory was added so operator facts survive restarts without bloating the daily scratch memory file.

---

## What We Learned

- Native config paths are safer than cross-surface patches. If the Gateway already owns a concern, keep the write path there.
- Budget policies only matter if every call goes through the enforcement layer. One direct SDK call is enough to invalidate the whole budget model.
- Usage needs two views: native session analytics for product-level visibility and ledger-level monitoring for burst/anomaly detection.
- Agent defaults should be explicit. Hidden inheritance is convenient until a provider mismatch ships unnoticed.
- Persistent memory and daily memory solve different problems. Mixing them makes both worse.

## What We Gained

- Per-agent model routing is now explicit and correct.
- The Google-backed agent is no longer pointed at an OpenAI model.
- Budget enforcement is centralized again.
- Usage checks are faster because the Gateway and ledger monitor now complement each other cleanly.
- The engineering Codex path is available without destabilizing default routing.

---

## Safety Properties

- `lc_adapter.py`: API key deleted from module namespace (`del _API_KEY`) after `ChatOpenAI` construction — not accessible via `lc_adapter._API_KEY`
- `echo_agent.py`: Binary file reads rejected; LLM output sanitized before return; optional strict path enforcement via `ECHO_STRICT_FS=1`
- `telegram_adapter.py`: Belt-and-suspenders `_sanitize_output()` applied to all outgoing messages
- No API keys in version-controlled files; `models.json` lives in `~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/` (outside sandbox)

## Browser Extensions (Brave — audit 2026-03-06)

| Extension ID | Name | Status |
|--------------|------|--------|
| `bfpnaggikhabdgbnhnngdfldkbinncdf` | OpenClaw Copilot | **DELETED** — was consuming shared API key via gateway |
| `jodblbhgdimkijbponngoammliocehel` | Token Monitor | Active — local storage only, safe |
| `pfhemcnpfilapbppdkfemikblgnnikdp` | Browser Relay | Active — port 18792 CDP relay, safe |

## Test Suites

```bash
cd sandboxes/langraph-echo-sandbox
.venv/bin/python -m pytest test_echo_agent.py test_security_audit.py test_telegram_audit.py test_voice_free.py test_langraph_bridge.py -q
```

> `test_adapter_full.py` is excluded from CI — it makes live API calls at module level.

Last recorded result: **161 passed, 1 skipped** (2026-03-06)
